In case anyone else wants to use their finished project files from [React Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-basics-2) to make sure they understand the changes Guil made off-screen, and know what React is doing behind the scenes in `create-react-app`, I recommend watching (or rewatching, in my case) Guil's videos on [Using Create React App](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/using-create-react-app) and following along, copying and pasting from your React Basics files and making any other needed changes.

Guil explains things really well in those videos, and you'll have a headstart on understanding the [React Components](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-components) course. Just use `npx create-react-app scoreboard` like Guil starts typing out in the video, as installing via [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is the [current recommendation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) for using create-react-app.

There will obviously be a bit of a learning curve vs. downloading the project files, and `create-react-app` did release a [new major version](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html) (v2) right as this course was launched (though I haven't encountered any breaking changes yet), but I recommend giving it a shot! If everything breaks, you can always just download the project files ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
